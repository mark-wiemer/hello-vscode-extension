# Hello, world!

This is my first VS Code extension from the ground up! It's my sandbox, not really meant for public consumption :)

It follows the guide at [Visual Studio Code - Your First Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension).

## Next steps

I'm currently reading [Language Extensions Overview](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/overview), as I want to improve [AutoHotkey Plus Plus](https://github.com/mark-wiemer/vscode-autohotkey-plus-plus)

Resources:
- [microsoft/vscode-textmate](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-textmate) is the library that tokenizes code via TextMate grammars
- [PanAeon/vscode-tmgrammar-test](https://github.com/PanAeon/vscode-tmgrammar-test) is recommended by Microsoft to write unit tests for TextMate grammars
